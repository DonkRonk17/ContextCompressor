## 🎨 Design System Context

**Project Identity:**
ContextCompressor is a smart context reduction tool for AI agents that dramatically reduces token usage by extracting relevant sections, summarizing content, and stripping unnecessary information. The visual identity should convey compression, efficiency, optimization, and intelligence.

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: Deep Blue (#1E3A8A) - Trust, intelligence, compression
- Secondary: Vibrant Cyan (#06B6D4) - Speed, efficiency, data flow
- Accent: Electric Purple (#8B5CF6) - AI, optimization, smart processing
- Highlight: Bright Green (#10B981) - Savings, success, reduction

**Visual Themes:**
- Compression/optimization (shrinking, condensing)
- Data flow (information moving efficiently)
- Intelligence (smart processing)
- Token reduction (cost savings)

## 1. Title Card Prompt (16:9 Aspect Ratio)

```
Create a professional title card for "ContextCompressor" - an AI context reduction tool.

COMPOSITION:
- 16:9 widescreen format
- Bold "ContextCompressor" text centered prominently
- Tagline below: "Smart Context Reduction for AI"
- Version badge: "v1.0" in corner

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- Background: Deep blue gradient (#1E3A8A to darker blue)
- Foreground: Vibrant cyan (#06B6D4) and electric purple (#8B5CF6) accents
- Central icon: Large data blocks or file icons being compressed/squeezed into smaller, optimized forms
- Visual metaphor: Show a large file/document on the left being transformed into a compact, streamlined version on the right
- Flowing lines connecting the transformation, suggesting efficient data flow
- Subtle circuit board or neural network pattern in the background
- Floating token symbols (☰ ☱ ☲) being reduced in number
- Glowing edges and neon accents for a modern tech feel

STYLE:
- Clean, professional, futuristic
- Modern tech aesthetic with neon/cyberpunk touches
- High contrast for visibility
- "Data optimization" meets "AI intelligence" visual language
- Should convey: compression, efficiency, cost savings, smart processing

TEXT:
- "ContextCompressor" - large, bold, sans-serif font
- "Smart Context Reduction for AI" - smaller subtitle
- "v1.0" badge in corner
- All text should be highly legible with glowing effects

The overall feel should be "This tool makes your AI cheaper and faster by intelligently compressing contexts."

## 2. Logo Mark Prompt (1:1 and 3:1 Aspect Ratios)

```
Create a professional logo mark for "ContextCompressor" - an AI context reduction tool.

ICON CONCEPT:
- Central symbol: Two overlapping brackets [ ] with compressed lines/data inside
- Alternative concept: A stylized "C" made of data streams that narrow/compress
- Or: A file/document icon with compression arrows (pointing inward) on both sides
- The icon should visually represent "taking something large and making it smaller"

VISUAL DETAILS:
- Primary color: Deep blue (#1E3A8A) for main structure
- Accent colors: Vibrant cyan (#06B6D4) and electric purple (#8B5CF6) for highlights
- Geometric, clean lines
- Suggest data flow and optimization
- Include subtle gradient or glow effects
- Small token symbols (☰) being reduced/compressed within the design

VARIATIONS NEEDED:
1. Square (1:1): Icon only, no text, suitable for app icon
2. Horizontal (3:1): Icon + "ContextCompressor" text beside it

STYLE:
- Modern, minimalist, professional
- Tech-forward aesthetic
- Scalable to small sizes
- Works in monochrome if needed
- Conveys: compression, data optimization, AI intelligence

BACKGROUND:
- For square version: Mostly translucent/transparent background with subtle aura
- For horizontal version: Transparent background, icon and text floating

The logo should be instantly recognizable and convey "smart compression" at a glance.

## 3. App Icon Prompt (1:1 Aspect Ratio, Small Format)

```
Create an app icon for "ContextCompressor" - an AI context reduction tool.
This icon must be simple, bold, and instantly recognizable at small sizes (16x16 to 512x512 pixels).

ICON DESIGN:
- Central element: Bold compression symbol
  Option A: Two square brackets [ ] with horizontal lines inside, compressed tight
  Option B: Stylized "CC" lettermark with compression arrows
  Option C: File icon with inward-pointing arrows showing compression
- Keep design VERY simple - must be legible at 16x16 pixels
- Use high contrast colors

COLOR SCHEME:
- Background: Deep blue (#1E3A8A) or dark gradient
- Foreground: Vibrant cyan (#06B6D4) and bright green (#10B981)
- Accent: Electric purple (#8B5CF6) for highlights
- Ensure high contrast for visibility

DETAILS:
- No text (icon only)
- Bold, thick lines (minimum 2-3 pixels wide at small sizes)
- Simple geometric shapes
- Avoid fine details that won't scale down
- Use glowing/neon effect on key elements
- Square format with slight corner rounding

STYLE:
- Ultra-clean and modern
- Tech icon aesthetic
- Must work at tiny sizes (favicon, taskbar)
- Should pop against light and dark backgrounds

FOCUS:
The icon should instantly communicate "compression" and "optimization" even at 32x32 pixels.
Think: What single visual symbol represents "making things smaller and smarter"?
